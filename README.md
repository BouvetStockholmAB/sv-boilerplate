## Why use this?

I wanted a skeleton project for the frontend stuff I use in almost all of my web projects to get started faster and to get the setup right with less effort every time. This boilerplate does that for me. Feel free to use it as you wish in your projects!

The boilerplate is created with SiteVision projects in mind but will probably work for any CMS. I will add setup for other CMSs in case I use this in other systems. 

My setup is:

- Development on OS X using IntelliJ IDEA, Web- or PhpStorm
- SiteVision CMS running on remote server
- Source code repo on GitHub
- Local webserver (using gulp-connect) to serve JS and CSS during development
- "Deploy" by building and pushing to GitHub Pages. The site will use the files at GitHub as a demo version during development. When the project is finished I will upload the files to the server.
  

## What's in the box

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) tasks.
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
- CSS minification.
- [Optimization of image assets](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-imagemin).
- Images embedded (Base64 encoded) in CSS on demand.
- Script concatention and minification.
- Setup for async loading of font-face fonts embedded in separate CSS.
- Setup for non-blocking async load of JavaScript file.
- Custom [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) builds based on usage in JS-files available.
- JSHint on build, .jshintrc for use by IDE.
- JSCS on build, .jscsrc for use by IDE. Uses customized version of [jQuery JS Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
- Serving assets from localhost
- Instructions and velocity script for including files in SiteVision (head)
- Bookmarklet to toggle dev- and production (or demo) mode


## Set up a new project

Prerequisites: Node.js

### GitHub Repo

- Create a new GitHub repository for the project
- Create branch `gh-pages`
- Delete master
- Clone repo to your computer

### Add the boilerplate

- Clone (or update) Boilerplate repo
- Copy files to new project repo
- Delete this README and rename Project-example-README.md to README.md. This is what will show up on GitHub. Edit the file to fit the project.

### Edit project files

- Edit package.json (Name, description, GitHub URLs)
- Edit _config.yml (set project name)
- Run `$ npm install`

If you run into errors with installing gulp-sass, try `$ npm install node-sass --unsafe-perm` and `$ npm install` again. This is because node-sass is not pure JavaScript module, it includes binary component as well as the custom installation scripts.


### SiteVision project site setup

Copy content from additional-head-elements.vm to SiteVision as an "Additional HEAD element" with Velocity type.


Add metadata (as links): 

- assetJsMain
- assetCssMain
- assetCssFonts (optional)
    
Set "Visible for roles" to "Administrator" for all.

Now you can build the site and deploy so you get your asset URLs. Point metadata in SiteVision to URLs on GitHub Pages.


## How to use

As you work on your web project you will "deploy" by pushing code to GitHub Pages. Everytime you do that, the site will be updated with your newest code for the customer to look at and test.

When you write the code you will serve your JS and CSS from a local webserver (started by Gulp). You need to tell SiteVision to fetch from your localhost instead of from GitHub. You do that by passing a URL parameter: `?devmode=true`.


### Gulp

#### Gulp Watch

`$ gulp watch` or `$ gulp`

- Start local webserver
- Watch `_js` and `_sass` folders for changes
- Build and concatenate JS on change
- Compile Sass to CSS on change
- Build custom version of Lodash based on usage in files

Default URLs for local files:

- http://localhost:8080/main.js
- http://localhost:8080/main.css

#### Gulp Build

`$ gulp build`

- Run JSHint and JSCS to check scripts
- Build, concatenate and minify JS
- Optimize images
- Compile Sass and minify the CSS
- Build custom version of Lodash based on usage in files (optional)
- Autoprefixer

`$ gulp build --rev`

- Same as `$ gulp build` but will add a timestamp to the file name.


#### LiveReload

When you start your localhost server with `$ gulp watch`, a script will be injected that live reloads your website (uses Web Sockets).

`$ gulp watch --nolive` to disable


### Git

I always forget how to Git from the command line. These are the commands I will use 99.9 % of the time:

- `$ git status`
- `$ git commit -a`
- `$ git pull --rebase`
- `$ git push`

After a `$ gulp build` I will do the commands above in order, and that will push my changes to GitHub and my website will be updated for the customer.

### Optimized images

All image assets in `_assets` folder will be optimized on build. It's a lossless optimization, but you might still want to keep another copy of the image file elsewhere.


### Embedded images

By using the function data-uri in your Sass code you may choose to embed an image in your CSS, Base64 encoded. 

`background-image: data-uri( "foo.svg" )`


### Async font-face

This is my prefered way of including font-face fonts. The advantage is that there will never be a blank screen while your fonts are loading. The fallback font will be visible first (on first page load only), then switched to the font-face font. With a good fallback, this will be quite invisible. On following requests, the font-face font will be stored in localStorage and applied immediately in head, so there will be no request at all.

The script loader (see [Async JS](#async-js)) will trigger loading of the font CSS file if it exists in metadata. The file is fetched asynchronously (AJAX) and stored in localStorage. On the next request we check if there is CSS in localStorage and, if so, skip the request. The CSS file will have the font-face font embedded as Base64.

- fonts.css must always be uploaded to the SiteVision server. It is fetched with AJAX so it must be on the same domain as the visited page.


### Sass 

The folder structure is using [the 7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture). 

You will probably want to go through the files and remove stuff you do not want. 

Some stuff included:

- Normalize CSS
- `data-uri` function for embedding image assets
- `em` and `rem` helper functions  
- Example on how to use same background multiple times with only one include (see `_bgimg-extends.scss`)


### Async JS

The main JS file will be loaded asynchronously. The load is triggered inline in head. That means you don't know if the JS will be executed before or after DOMContentLoaded, and have to write your JS accordingly.

The advantage with this model is that there will be no blocking JS request. The script that triggers the load is inlined and the JS file is async, so the only file that is blocking the page load in head is the main CSS file.


### Init JS module

Modules (functions) in your JS that you want to invoke on certain pages should be initialized from the HTML. 

Example:

Put this anywhere in the HTML body:
`<script> _b.init.push( 'BV.fooBar' ) </script>`

On DOMContentLoaded or when the main script file has finished loading (whichever occurs last), the function BV.fooBar will be invoked.



### Lodash

You may use Lodash in your JS files, but must first uncomment one row in `gulpfile.js` so it is included in the build. 

Gulp will search for usage of Lodash and build a custom version with only the parts of Lodash that is needed.
 

### Autoprefixer

Autoprefixer will check your CSS files and add vendor prefixes if needed based on the latest information from [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com). You write CSS without worrying about vendor prefixes, like this:

```
.foo { transition: transform 1s; }
```

When you save the file, Autoprefixer transforms that rule into cross-browser CSS:

```
.foo { -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 1s; transition: transform 1s }
```
